        `Hello. I'm Mark C Hoffner. I am a Full Stack Developer based in the New York metropolitan area.`,
        `I am a curious, ever-learning web developer and collaborative teammate, excited to find my next project.`,
        `After over a decade working behind the scenes in live performance, I transitioned my personal interests 
        in technology and development into a professional career building VR and web apps for a tech focused, live 
        performance startup. I learned a host of web languages and frameworks, while focusing on building durable, 
        testable code. I leveraged Azure products to make the apps resilient and scalable, while limiting cloud costs. 
        Being a solo developer and managing a live product, I learned to balance and prioritize bug fixes and feature requests, 
        while buidling up DevOps pipelines to automate away repetitive work and increase my rate of deliverables.`,
        `I am now seeking new opportunities to further my knowledge while building awesome web products.`
